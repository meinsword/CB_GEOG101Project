Introduction

Jamaica, Queens is one of the fastest growing areas of New York City. Between 2010 and 2020, it saw growth at almost double the rate of the rest of the city. What makes Jamaica unique in this growth is that It was almost entirely comprised of Asians moving into the neighborhood while all other demographics saw declines at even greater rates than the rest of the city. The reason for this is multi-faceted, and something worth exploring as the Asian population only continues to grow not just in Jamaica, but in New York City and the United States in general. What draws people here?

The goal of this project is to explore why Jamaica is such a desirable place specifically for Asian Americans and the draws for particular communities who have moved into the neighborhood.
